XMMS2GO
=====

[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/tonychee7000/xmms2go?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/tonychee7000/xmms2go)

A golang binding to libxmmsclient.

Notice
-----

We need so much work todo:

* Medialib
* Config
* Playlist
* PlayBack (play pause stop tickle is okay)
* Stats
* Visualization
* C2C
* Service

Em, I wish someone could convert xmmsdict and xmmslist to Go map and slice, for my poor C skill.
